## Background information

The client wants a quick update on the project progress.

The AD wants you to draft an abstract (executive summary) of your findings so far.

## Tasks

Develop an abstract slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far, keeping in mind that this will be for the key stakeholders meeting which the Head of the SME division, as well as other various stakeholders, will be attending.

Note: a steering committee meeting is a meeting where the BCG team presents key findings and recommendations (and/or project progress) to key client stakeholders.

Please use the template below and submit your summary slide in PDF format.

A few things to think about for this abstract include:

- What is the most important number or metric to share with the client?
- What impact would the model have on the client’s bottom line?

Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the sample answer is just one way to do it.
